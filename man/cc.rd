\details{'cc' usually reads in two variables whereas in 'cci' four number are entered manually. However, both the variables and the numbers should be omitted if the analysis is directly on a table specified by 'cctable'.

From both functions, odds ratio and its confidence limits, chisquared test and Fisher's exact test are computed. The odds ratio calcuation is based on cross product method unless 'fisher.or' is set as TRUE. It's confidence limits are obtained by the exact method unless exact.ci.or is set as FALSE.

'cs' and 'csi' are for cohort and cross-sectional studies. It computes the absolute risk, risk difference, and risk ratio. When the exposure is a risk factor, the attributable fraction exposure, attributable fraction population and number needed to harm (NNH) are also displayed in the output. When the exposure is a protective factor, protective efficacy or percent of risk reduced and number needed to treat (NNT) are displayed instead. 

If there are more than 2 exposure categories and the sample size is large enough, a graph will be plotted.

'method' in 'csi' and 'cs' chooses whether confidence limits of the risk difference should be computed by Newcomb-Wilson method. Both this and the standard method may give non-sensible values if the risk difference is not statistically significant.

'make2x2' creates a 2-by-2 table using the above orientation.

'graph.casecontrol' and 'graph.prospective' draw a graph comparing the odds of exposure between cases and controls or odds of diseased between exposed and non-exposed.

These two graphic commands are automatically chosen by 'cc' and 'cci', depending on the 'design' argument.

Alternatively, a contingency table saved from 'make2x2' can be supplied as the 'cctable' argument for the 'cc' function and so on.
