\details{
There are two different principles of calculation for kappa statistic. 'kap.table' and 'kap.2.raters' use two fixed raters whereas 'kap.m.raters' and 'kap.ByCategory' are based on frequency of category of rating an individual received without a requirement that the raters must be fixed.

'kap.table' analyses kappa statistics from a predefined table of agreement of two raters.
 
'wttable' is important only if the rating can be more than 2 levels. If this argument is left as default or 'NULL', full agreement will be weighted as 1. Partial agreement is considered as non-agreement and weighted as 0. 

When 'wttable = "w"' the weights are given by \deqn{1 - abs(i - j)/(1 - k)} where i and j index the rows and columns of the ratings and k is the maximum number of possible ratings. A weight of 1 indicates an observation of perfect agreement.

When 'wttable = "w2", the weights are given by \deqn{1 - (abs(i - j)/(1 - k))^2.} In this case, weights of partial agreements will further increase.

'wttable' can otherwise be defined by the user.
 
'kap.2.raters' takes two vectors or factors, one for each of the two raters. Cross-tabulation of the two raters is displayed and automatically forwarded for computation of kappa statistic by 'kap.table'.

'kap.m.raters' is used for more than 2 raters. Although the variables are arranged based on columns of individual raters, only the frequency in each category rating is used. This function calculates the frequencies without any display and automatically forwards the results for computation by 'kap.ByCategory'.

'kap.ByCategory' is for the grouped data format, where each category (column) contains the counts for each individual subject being rated.  As mentioned above, the frequencies can come from different sets of raters.
